Outside Libraries/References
---

For this project you *do not* have to write everything from scratch.

You may *reference* demo programs from books or the web, and *include* popular web libraries like Bootstrap, JQuery, Backbone, React, Meteor, etcetera. 

Please *do not* use libraries on top of d3, however. Libraries like nvd3.js look tempting, but such libraries often have poor defaults and result in poor visualizations.
Instead, draw from the numerous existing d3 examples on the web, factoring the building of visualizations into your timeline.

If you use outside sources please provide a References section with links at the end of your Readme.

Resources / Ideas
---

The "[Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive)" weekly letter often contains interesting datasets.

OurWorldInData has good datasets, as well.

In general, implementing techniques from research papers, or conducting new experiments, is a solid way to get a project that is both within scope, interesting, and beneficial to you in the long run.

Requirements
---

Store the following in your github repository:

- Code - All web site files and libraries assuming they are not too big to include
- Data - Include all the data that you used in your project. If the data is too large for github store it on a cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Yousendit.
- Process Book- Your Process Book in PDF format.
- README - The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.

GitHub Details
---

- Fork the repo. You now have a copy associated with your username.
- Make changes to index.html to fulfill the project requirements. 
- Make sure your "master" branch matches your "gh-pages" branch. See the GitHub Guides referenced above if you need help.
- Edit the README.md with a link to your gh-pages or other external site: for example http://YourUsernameGoesHere.github.io/DataVisFinal/index.html
- To submit, make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on the original repository.

Grading
---

- Prospectus - Did the prospectus contain sufficient thought, detail, and related work to facilitate a clear project plan?
- Process Book - Are you following a design process that is well documented in your process book?
- Solution - Is your visualization effective in answering your intended questions? Was it designed following visualization principles?
- Implementation - What is the quality of your implementation? Is it appropriately polished, robust, and reliable?
- Presentation - Are your web site and screencast clear, engaging, and effective?
Your individual project score will also be influenced by your peer evaluations.

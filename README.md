Index.html is the main project website file. Add_map.js creates the Massachusetts map visualization, based on [this repository](https://gist.github.com/michaschwab/411cbbd398e9b74e297f4aecf0410f70) using [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/). Vis.py contains the script for data cleaning and exploratory visualizations. The data folder contains all data used for the final visualizations, exploratory visualizations, and geographic data for the map. The line graph references code from [here](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_basic.html), and the bar chart references code from [here](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/barplot_horizontal.html).

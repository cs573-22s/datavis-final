## ReadMe
As for libraries, we used the javascript library with Geo.path for the world map. When creating the node/force graph, we used a force directed algorithm and had the forces between the elements set to be attracted to the center of gravity and repel one another. The rest of the code is from what we were able to learn in class and from the previous assignments. 
The features for the filtered graph are able to be an and/or selection, but it will always show a gene and a drug on the resulting bar chart. Also, the force node graph will move and thus may change what the mouse is hovering over making it difficult to pick a specific node under a specific gene. Also the cloud og nodes around each root is collapible if the mouse hovers over the root/center.
